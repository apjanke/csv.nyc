I walk up to the lib like, "What up? I found a sick shot!"<br/>
I'm so pumped making grans with the gif shop<br/>
Sepia on the fringe, pos stained by coffee<br/>
That people like, "Damn! That's from an old ass talkie."<br/>
Slide it in, scale it clean, I scan from a magazine,<br/>
Bring it all neat, 'cept the paper's torn, that's my b <br/>
Bright goes the machine, light shinin' through to me<br/>
Probably shoulda framed this, holes like my fav'rite cheese<br/>

Passin' up on 3D glyphin' someone else's been rockin' 'em<br/>
Cyan and funky, 50s, man<br/>
I am creatin' and sharin' and<br/>
Savin' history and I'm hella happy that's some civic kitsch<br/>
I'ma take your grandpa's files, I'ma take your grandpa's files,<br/>
No for real - ask your grandpa - can I have his daguerrotypes? (Thank you)<br/>
Fort Warren with some big cannon<br/>
Jumping round yellow temple that I found diggin'<br/>
They had a view of Lake George, I made a view of Lake George<br/>
Made a steamship flank it, then I found a dock for't<br/>
Hello, hello, my sweet fam, so mellow <br/>
John Wayne ain't got nothing on her fringe game, hell no<br/>
You could take some old scenes, glue em up, gif those<br/>
NYPL heads would be like "Aw, this techno's retro"<br/>
