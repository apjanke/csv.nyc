Hi friends of the comma,

Last week our musical arm played its first show in San Francisco.  Much fun was had and primitive cpu keyboards were broken.  Watch the highlights in this video made by the amazing Lam Thuy Vo: http://vimeo.com/76190871.

This week, 'Man in the Middle' by Michael Jackson (AKA @aubergene)

<br/>
I'm gonna make a change<br/>
For once in my life<br/>
It's gonna feel real good<br/>
Gonna make a diff<br/>
Gonna make it right<br/>
<br/>
As I, turn off the trust in<br/>
My proxy from Blue Coat<br/>
This algo is monitoring my mind<br/>
I see the kids on their phone<br/>
With not enough unix<br/>
Who am I to be teaching bind?<br/>
Pretending not to see their needs<br/>
<br/>
LulzSec disregard, a tin foil hat top<br/>
And a one man Snowden<br/>
They follow each other on Twitter ya' know<br/>
'Cause they got nowhere to go<br/>
That's why I want you to know<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting with the man in the middle<br/>
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze<br/>
And no message will ever be sent clear text<br/>
If you want to make the net a safer place<br/>
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change<br/>
<br/>
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of web<br/>
It's time that I realize<br/>
That there are some with no HTTPS, not a DNS to own<br/>
Could it be really me, pretending they're not tracking?<br/>
<br/>
A web of trust deeply scared, Stallman's broken heart<br/>
And a washed-out dream<br/>
They follow the pattern worse is better ya' see<br/>
'Cause they got no place to be<br/>
That's why I'm starting with HTTP<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting with the man in the middle<br/>
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze<br/>
And no message will ever be sent clear text<br/>
If you want to make the net a safer place<br/>
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting with the man in the middle<br/>
I'm encrypting to evade his gaze<br/>
And no message will ever be sent clear text<br/>
If you want to make the net a safer place<br/>
Take a look at yourself, and then make that<br/>
Change!<br/>
