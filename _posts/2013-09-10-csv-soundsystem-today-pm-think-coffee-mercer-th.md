<br/>
Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God<br/>
I don't know but today seems kinda odd<br/>
No errors in my logs, no clog<br/>
And HN's got a link out to my blog <br/>
I got my Tweet on, a little bump in Klout<br/>
Finally got a follow from a girl we're gonna nerd out<br/>
Hooked it up on the later as I hit the do'<br/>
Thinking will my score grow, another twenty-fo'<br/>
I can always go cause I got me a laptop<br/>
And if I hit the switch, I can the tables drop<br/>
Had to stop at a red light<br/>
Raspberry Pi's just booting to our main site<br/>
And everything is alright<br/>
I got a beep from vim but I just choose overwrite<br/>
IRC'd with the homies and I'm askin y'all<br/>
Which port, are y'all logging server calls?<br/>
Get me on the LAN and I'm trouble<br/>
Last week mucked around and commandeered the Hubble<br/>
Reimplemented RSA and blocked the NSA<br/>
I can't believe, today was a good day<br/>
