[Hook]<br/>
I run codes<br/>
[I geo-code]<br/>
In different map projections<br/>
CODES! In different map projections<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 1 - Ludagis]<br/>
Now you thought I was just ED50 & WGS-84?<br/>
I'm worldwide, act like y'all don't know<br/>
It's the abominable lo-cation<br/>
Globe address resolving post man<br/>
QGIS/PostGIS pope, man<br/>
NAV-D 88's and Beidou-2<br/>
I send small cities and states geo-planning tools.<br/>
<br/>
Luzon 19-11, matter fact - VL 19-15<br/>
I'll grab the GPS, we can find POI’s<br/>
So control your map points and digitize on<br/>
Til I close these shapes up and extract polygons<br/>
IGN62, IGN63 (oh), IRENET95, NAND-8-tree's (oh)<br/>
<br/>
Check your geo-loc and watch for geocode ‘urrz<br/>
WMS on one port; these tiles is self serve<br/>
ETRS-89, JGD -’00, my OSM overloads<br/>
<br/>

[Nate Dogg]<br/>
Is it cause they like my G-Maps walk? [G-Maps walk]<br/>
Is it cuz they like my G-Maps talk? G-Maps talk]<br/>
Is it cuz they like my hand-traced SHPs? [hand-traced SHPs]<br/>
Is it cuz they like my ESRI ways?<br/>
Wherever they is, they love it<br/>
And they just won't just check in me<br/>
<br/>
I handles my load don't rush me<br/>
Just relax; address API be free<br/>
I’ll track yo place (yo place), when you running<br/>
I got that mad geodesey<br/>
You know my routes resolve (resolve), stop fronting<br/>
Or I'll load my alternate map sheets<br/>
