Push it to delimit. <br/>
Split along the comma's edge, <br/>
but don't look down, just parse the line <br/>
until its finished. <br/>

Open up, delimit. <br/>
Past the point of carriage return <br/>
You've maxed your ram but still you gotta learn <br/>
how to skim it. <br/>

Hit the spinning wheel from double line breaks <br/>
rows wide open like a bat out of hell <br/>
and you crash IE8 <br/>
(crash IE8) <br/>

Welcome to delimit <br/>
(delimit) <br/>
(delimit) <br/>
