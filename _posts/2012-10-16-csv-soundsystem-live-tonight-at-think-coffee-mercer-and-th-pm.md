title: csv soundsystem: live tonight at Think! Coffee, Mercer and 4th, 7 PM
---



From now on, Michael and I will only send out our invitations in rhymed verse. This week, a limerick:

huzzah! huzzah! another CSV! <br/>
join us, won't you? for quiche and tea. <br/>
      all the bugs in your code <br/>
      will most surely explode, <br/>
and i might finally learn ruby. <br/>


In other news, I (Brian) will be leaving my job soon at Harmony Institute and I'm looking for a replacement.  Check out the attached job description and share with your nerdy friends. Thanks!
