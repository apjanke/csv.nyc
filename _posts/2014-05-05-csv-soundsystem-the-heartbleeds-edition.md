We'll be at WhyNot Coffee in the west village tomorrow at 7 PM. Come hang out and do something you've been putting off.<br/>
<br/>
And, as promised, The Knife's "Heartbleeds"<br/>
<br/>

One bug to reproduce<br/>
One bug to be abused<br/>
We had a promise made<br/>
A ping to know my state<br/>
Trusting your diligence<br/>
We had a fine fence<br/>
To block wayward gaze<br/>
My keys your promenade<br/>
<br/>
To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
<br/>
One night of h4x0r rush<br/>
The start - a simple touch<br/>
One night to push and dream<br/>
A golden fleece<br/>
These keys your secret runes<br/>
I see you use GNU<br/>
We had a promise made<br/>
We were in love<br/>
<br/>
To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>

One night of h4x0r rush<br/>

We had a promise made<br/>

To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
<br/>
And you, you knew the hand of a devil<br/>
And you kept us awake in a false sheeth<br/>
Making all our hearts bleed in one night<br/>
<br/>
To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
To want freeware's not enough to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>

ORIGINAL<br/>

One night to be confused<br/>
One night to speed up truth<br/>
We had a promise made<br/>
Four hands and then away<br/>
Both under influence<br/>
We had divine sense<br/>
To know what to say<br/>
Mind is a razorblade<br/>
<br/>
To call for hands of above to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
<br/>
One night of magic rush<br/>
The start - a simple touch<br/>
One night to push and scream<br/>
And then relief<br/>
Ten days of perfect tunes<br/>
The colors red and blue<br/>
We had a promise made<br/>
We were in love<br/>
<br/>
To call for hands of above to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
To call for hands of above to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, oh<br/>
<br/>
And you, you knew the hand of a devil<br/>
And you kept us awake with wolves teeth<br/>
Sharing different heartbeats in one night<br/>
<br/>
To call for hands of above to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, no<br/>
To call for hands of above to lean on<br/>
Wouldn't be good enough for me, oh<br/>
