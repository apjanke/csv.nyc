We'll be meeting tomorrow (tuesday the 4th) at 7pm at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village in the downstairs Jazz room.

Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york

They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village.

Join us, won't you?

This week, Hall & Oates in their classic 1981 single "-u Makes Upstreams Push True", about the joy in setting your remote branch so you don't have to waste time specifying branches later on.

What I want -u's got<br/>
And it might need t'auth my handle<br/>
Avoid the [shame that's wearing sandals](http://csvsoundsystem.us3.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=93591895dc074a74bb7667416&id=4e84c72f98&e=f649fb7443)<br/>
The sandal shells of shame<br/>
Yeah, yeah,<br/>
What I've got's full blocks<br/>
Of naughts and streams my chatter<br/>
Then you push them all together<br/>
And how I now explain<br/>
Oh, yeah<br/>
Well, well -u<br/>
(Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
Well, well, well -u<br/>
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)<br/>
Oh, yeah<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
<br/>
On a night when a bad branch becomes a screamer<br/>
Merges messin' with the vimmer<br/>
I can laugh it in the face<br/>
:wq and ! my way out<br/>
And wrap a flag around me<br/>
'Cos origins don't confound me<br/>
And it'll always be the same<br/>
Oh, yeah<br/>
Well, 'cos -u<br/>
(Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
Well, well, well -u<br/>
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
<br/>
Listen to this<br/>
<br/>
I'm pushing to this stream<br/>
Oh, those objects should be counted by now<br/>
I know<br/>
'Bout -u<br/>
Well, ye-aahh<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
Oh, yeah<br/>
I've waited for, waited for -u git<br/>
(-u-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)<br/>
Oh, yeah<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
-u and me, -u and me...<br/>
(-u-hoo, -u, -hoo, -u-hoo, hoo, -u)<br/>
I've waited for, waited for -u git<br/>
-u makes upstreams push true<br/>
Oh<br/>
Oh-oh<br/>
I've waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for, waited for<br/>

I've been waiting for -u git<br/>
