`Twas fixed, and the slithy widths<br/>
  Did gyre and gimble in the text file:<br/>
All mimsy were the headers,<br/>
  And the file paths outdated.<br/>
<br/>
"Beware the Fixiewock, my son!<br/>
  The line endings that bite, the indentations that catch!<br/>
Beware the Footnote bird, and shun<br/>
  The frumious Text-to-columns-snatch!"<br/>
<br/>
He took his parsal Python in hand:<br/>
  Long time the .txt foe he sought --<br/>
So rested he by the Regular Expression tree,<br/>
  And stood awhile in UltraEdit.<br/>
<br/>
And, as in CSVish thought he stood,<br/>
  The Fixiewock, with special characters of lame,<br/>
Came whiffling through the hacky scraper,<br/>
  And errbled as it came! <br/>
<br/>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
  The parsal script went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its output<br/>
  He went piping back.<br/>
<br/>
"And, has thou slain the Fixiewock?<br/>
  Come to my arms, my tired boy!<br/>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br/>
  He exclamation-separated his values in his joy.<br/>
  <br/>

`Twas fixed, and the slithy widths
  Did gyre and gimble in the text file:
All mimsy were the headers,
  And the file paths outdated.

Join us, won't you?
