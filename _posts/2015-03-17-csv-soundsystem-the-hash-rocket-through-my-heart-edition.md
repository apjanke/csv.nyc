This week, we pour one out for Ruby 1.9.3, which was officially deprecated last month: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/23/support-for-ruby-1-9-3-has-ended/). In tribute, called up Twin Shadow who coincidentally said he had this half-written already. He said he was sad to see 1.9.3 go — it has been good to him all these years — but at the time time, 2.0.0 looks really promising and he's looking forward to the future. Here's what he sent us:
