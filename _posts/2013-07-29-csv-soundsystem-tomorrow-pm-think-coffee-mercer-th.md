hey all,
<br/>
last week we did good by the comma and won best in show at the New York Times science fair - http://tech.gilt.com/post/56819208172/baking-soda-volcanoes-need-not-apply-highlights-from.
<br/>
This week, D.R.E.A.M. by the group that also inspired our organizational philosophy:<br/>

<br/>
data rules everything around me, D.R.E.A.M.<br/>
get the memory, giga gigabytes y'all<br/>
<br/>
I grew up on them text files, default Excel styles,<br/>
using BDAM was no jam,<br/>
so little RAM, comp froze on man man,<br/>
so then I moved Cloud-land,<br/>
a young youth, letting my scripts loose, error proof,<br/>
only way I began a day off was map-reduce<br/>
and let's awk it like this son, greping on this one and that one<br/>
pulling out stats for fun<br/>
But it was just a dream for a screen, a data fiend<br/>
Started scraping sites at sixteen<br/>
and firing up Hbase, calculate page-rank,<br/>
reduce dimensions of the feature space<br/>
no question I could see, P of A given B,<br/>
but the proofs made my eyes bleed.<br/>
and no question I would seek it all to make n equal all,<br/>
Slicing up DBs with SQL calls,<br/>
But life got no better, same damn old measures,<br/>
Insights are rough and tough like leather<br/>
Figured out I went the wrong route<br/>
So I got with some sick journalists and went all out<br/>
Catching leaks from agencies,<br/>
FOIA'n for DB's, every week we went to csv,<br/>
so open command line, or fire up sublime,<br/>
g-git-POW, and join us, wont you now?<br/>
