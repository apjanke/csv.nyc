To commemorate government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis, here's Huey Lewis and the News with "The Power of Gov"<br/>

<br/>
The power of gov is a curious sitch<br/>
Make a one man poor, make another man rich<br/>
grind society into dystopic dust<br/>
More than the ceiling, that’s the power of gov <br/>
Tougher than Boehner, rich like Cruz<br/>
Stronger and harder than unregulated booze<br/>
Make the fed rate low, raise the money supply<br/>
Power of gov, keeps you wondering why<br/>
It’s not just money, it’s not just a bank,<br/>
can’t cut the deficit to mend the state<br/>
It’s strong and it’s sudden and it’s cruel sometimes <br/>
But it might just save your life <br/>
That’s the power of gov<br/>
That’s the power of gov<br/>
<br/>
