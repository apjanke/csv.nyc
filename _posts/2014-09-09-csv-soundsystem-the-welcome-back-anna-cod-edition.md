title: csv soundsystem, The "Welcome back Anna Cod" Edition
---
Starting at 6:45pm *this evening* we'll be at the Antler Beer & Wine Dispensary where they have a whole room with couches, tables and stools. It's at Delancey and Allen, Northwest corner right under a sign for the "Yeah man span."

The jalapeño mac & cheese is topped with cheetos for [mouthfeel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel) purposes.

Tonight we welcome back Anna Cod who I believe was at the first csv and who has just moved back to New York. You should follow her on Twitter: twitter.com/annacod.

We forgot to celebrate the two-year csversary, which was June 17th — or thereabouts. So we'll celebrate that, as well.
