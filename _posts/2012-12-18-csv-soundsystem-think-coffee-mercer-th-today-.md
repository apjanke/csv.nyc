This week: Pulp's "Comma People" <br/>

She came to J-School with a thirst for data. <br/>
She went to Susan's tutorial at Strata. <br/>
That's where I, <br/>
Caught her eye. <br/>
She told me that excel was drama. <br/> 
I said "In that case, 'awk dash F quote comma'." <br/>
She said "Fine." <br/>
And in thirty milliseconds time, <br/>
She said, <br/>
<br/>
"I want to live like comma people, <br/>
I want to do whatever comma people do, <br/>
I want to code with comma people, <br/>
I want to code with comma people, like you." <br/>
Well what else could i do? - I said "I'll add you to the google group" <br/>
<br/>
I took her to a media start up. <br/>
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere, <br/>
so it started there. <br/>
I said pretend you cant use D3. <br/>
She just laughed and said, <br/>
"Oh you're so funny." <br/>
I said "yeah? <br/>
Well I can't see anyone rendering SVG in here" <br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you want to live like comma people <br/>
you want to speak however comma people speak <br/>
you want to hack with comma people <br/>
you want to hack with comma people <br/>
like me <br/>
But she was kind of out of wits, <br/>
she just smiled and read my gists <br/>
<br/>
Rent a server in the cloud.<br/>
Tweet some articles on Tow.<br/>
Style some divs and push repos.<br/>
Pretend you never use S.O.<br/>
But still you'll never get it right<br/>
Cause when you're hacking late at night<br/>
watching errors fill your log<br/>
if you paid MTurkers they could do your job<br/>
<br/>
You'll never code like the comma people.<br/>
You'll never do whatever comma people do.<br/>
You'll never live like comma people.<br/>
You'll never watch your tuesdays slip out view,<br/>
and hack at think with brews.<br/>
because there's nothing better to do.<br/>
