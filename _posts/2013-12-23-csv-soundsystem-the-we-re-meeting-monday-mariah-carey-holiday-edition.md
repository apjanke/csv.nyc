This week's song, "All I Want for Christmas is Brew" by Mariah Carey.
<br/>
The story of a brew install failing on a NumPy error right before Christmas.
<br/>
Note: The framework tcl/tk should be pronounced "tickle-tock."<br/>

I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
There is just one tool I need<br/>
I don't care about the presents<br/>
Underneath the Christmas tree<br/>
<br/>
I just want to tcl/tk<br/>
More than pip could ever stock<br/>
Make my $path read true<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew<br/>
<br/>
I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
There is just one thing I need<br/>
And I don't care about the presents<br/>
Underneath the Christmas tree<br/>
<br/>
I just tried to brew my frameworks<br/>
From out there in cyberspace<br/>
NumPy error don't make me happy<br/>
Such an "oy" on Christmas Day<br/>
<br/>
I just want to tcl/tk<br/>
More than pip could ever stock<br/>
Make my $path read true<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew<br/>
Brew, baby<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas<br/>
I don't really need GEOS<br/>
So I'm just gonna keep on reading<br/>
Plenty from Stack Overflow<br/>
<br/>
I won't write a list and post it<br/>
Of seven ways.. that same ol' shtick<br/>
I won't even stay awake to<br/>
See those viral viewer clicks<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I just want brew here tonight<br/>
Loading all the things so right<br/>
What more can I do?<br/>
Baby, all I want for Christmas is brew<br/>
Brew, baby<br/>
<br/>
Oh, all the errors are shining<br/>
Till I pull out my hair<br/>
And the thought of building<br/>
Tonight fills me with despair<br/>
<br/>
And everyone is singing<br/>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br/>
Fanta, won't you bring me energy I really need?<br/>
Won't you please bring my library to me?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas<br/>
This is all I'm asking for<br/>
I just want to see my library<br/>
Loading right without a chore<br/>
<br/>
I just want to tcl/tk<br/>
More than pip could ever stock<br/>
Make my $path read true<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew<br/>
Brew, baby<br/>
<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew, baby<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew, baby<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew, baby<br/>
All I want for Christmas is brew, baby<br/>
