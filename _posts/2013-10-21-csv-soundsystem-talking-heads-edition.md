This week's song:

Chrome - is where I want to be<br/>
Firefox always shuts down<br/>
IE's numb - made without real art<br/>
this is not the web we spun <br/>
The less I use Safari the better<br/>
Animating so much seems wrong<br/>
Keep tabs around<br/>
Memory's fine<br/>
It's ok I know nothing's wrong... nothing<br/>
<br/>
Hiyah I inspect all my sites<br/>
Hiyah You spot a blight in my styles<br/>
And the network tab beside me<br/>
Shows image rendering times<br/>
Never too many<br/>
Always enough<br/>
Glue em up replace with sprites... replace with sprites.<br/>
<br/>
Chrome - is where i want to be<br/>
But i guess i'm already there<br/>
I come home -- she loaded my bookmarks<br/>
I guess that this must be the place<br/>
I can't sail the web with another <br/>
Did i find you, or you find me?<br/>
There was a time<br/>
before you were born<br/>
If someone asks, I used Opera 3... Opera 3.<br/>
<br/>
Hiya clear all my cache out<br/>
Hiya speak this page with "Ralph"<br/>
Out of all those kinds of browsers<br/>
You've got UX I can use<br/>
I'm just a google'r looking for info<br/>
Traverse the graph in a second or two<br/>
And you store all my extensions<br/>
Cookie's never dead<br/>
Forms fill right up, ads out of view<br/>
Filter out the spam bots<br/>
Hit Gecko on the head - I go hooooh-oooooh<br/>
<br/>
