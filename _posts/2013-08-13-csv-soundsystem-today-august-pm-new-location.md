This week we'll be trying out the lobby of the Ace Hotel on 29th Street between 5th and Broadway. We hear they have Stumptown coffee, drinks, couches, tables, and unfunded startups that use it as an office.

Here's a map of where it is because we google for a living, sometimes we want a break: http://bit.ly/16HooIk

This week's song / poem

More than this by Roxy Music re-imagined as an ode to the ups and downs of the "this" keyword in JavaScript.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I could feel at runtime<br/>
There was no way of knowing<br/>
this.showMe() was the line<br/>
Who can say what it's showing<br/>
So free without .bind()<br/>
Hopefully referring<br/>
To the "Me" in my mind<br/>
With no sense of scoping<br/>
<br/>
More than this<br/>
You know there's nothing more than this <br/>
Tell me one thing more than this <br/>
ooh there is nothing<br/>
<br/>
that = this was fun for a while<br/>
There's a simple way of storing<br/>
Which context was right<br/>
And methods were going<br/>
No care in the world<br/>
Maybe I'm learning<br/>
Why this this in a block<br/>
Has no way of noting<br/>
<br/>
More than this<br/>
You know there's nothing more than this<br/> 
Tell me one thing more than this <br/>
ooh there is nothing<br/>
<br/>
More than this nothing<br/>
More than this<br/>
More than this nothing<br/>
<br/>
