title: csv soundsystem    tomorrow    May 8    Think Coffee    Mercer + 4th
---


If you're new to the list and these poem filled emails aren't all that clear in terms of itinerary, csv soundsystem is a Wednesday thing where you can bring your laptop and work on something you've been meaning to make some progress on while hanging out with people doing the same. Sometimes people work together on projects but there are no rules. 
<br/>
In news announcements, one project that's come out of the meetup just got a Knight-Mozilla code sprint grant to build an API for US treasury data (http://dansinker.com/post/49856260511/opennews-code-sprints-do-some-spring-cleaning-on-data). So this week I imagine some folks will be working on that.
<br/>
We also send a programming- / journalism-themed riff on a song or poem along with this weekly reminder.

This week: Histomania

<br/>
So representative, not representative no<br/>
Distribution all distorted yet<br/>
Darling, I'm skewed left and lonely<br/>
When with the Poisson only<br/>
I've been looking for something else<br/>
Do let, do let, log of it, do let, do let, do<br/>
<br/>
Let's go slowly Bernoulli<br/>
Different from another coin-toss on your favorite silver dollar<br/>
This flip's pure randomness only, that's in the theory only<br/>
No, I gotta pick something else<br/>
These days a point comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes<br/>
<br/>
Histomania<br/>
Think negative and see it grow<br/>
Like a binom- like a binomial<br/>
It's fairly easily extended<br/>
It's not hard to bin them all<br/>
From the peaks to the valleys<br/>
