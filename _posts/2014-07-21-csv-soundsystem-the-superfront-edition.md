title: csv soundsystem, The SUPERFRONT EDITION
---
In a continuation of our "Bouger plus" Summer Series (sponsor: http://www.mangerbouger.fr/bouger-plus/), we're getting out of the coffee shop this week and heading over to Greenpoint where Clarisa is doing a talk about some of her SUPERCOOL past projects in Cambodia and New York at SUPERFRONT.<br/>
<br/>
It's interesting not just for the subject matter but because SUPERFRONT's name case style is exactly the opposite of csv soundsystem's, make of that contrast what you will.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the info:<br/>
 <br/>
Tuesday July 22<br/>
7:30pm-10pm, at Freeman Space<br/>
155 Freeman Street<br/>
Greenpoint, Brooklyn<br/>
