"Python Thing" <br/>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hYTjBhplTGY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br/>
sick of perl, real sick of perl<br/>
need something clean in my script-heavy world<br/>
git pull and i see dot py's<br/>
traversin' lists in only one line<br/>
sittin back with these keys at my hand<br/>
pip'n PyPI 'stead of CPAN<br/>
whitespace on my mind every minute<br/>
init my repos and you always in it, yo<br/>
<br/>
it's such a python thing,<br/>
python thing, a python thing<br/>
<br/>
and even though my code's fly,<br/>
i give my ifs space and use single trys,<br/>
actin like pythonistas<br/>
dont even try to front, coffee script barristas<br/>
console telling me that she want ASCII,<br/>
I say 'I dunno' and raise Exception as e:<br/>
and when we do hackathons<br/>
we go on and on and on and on and on and<br/>
Sicker than Van Rossom<br/>
can I script lines?<br/>
well you know I git mine.<br/>
building code round simple args<br/>
breaking complex tasks into simple parts, yo<br/>
<br/>
it's such a python thing,<br/>
python thing, a python thing<br/>
