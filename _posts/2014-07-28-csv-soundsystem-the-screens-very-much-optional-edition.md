title: csv soundsystem, The Screens Very Much Optional Edition
---
This week we'll be convening tomorrow (7/29) at 6:45pm at Berkli Parc Caf√© on the Lower East Side at Delancey & Allen on the Southwest corner.

We're trying something new where at the last Tuesday of the month Michael and Brian go no-screen so that we might better discuss and share ideas with any other members.

We've been fairly Kantian about declining any formal structure to csv soundsystem but we think this is a good modification for two reasons

1) Technically, it increases the overall entropy and maintains an agenda-less spirit since now Michael and Brian have no idea what they're going to do;

2) It can make it nicer for new people to come and meet people.
