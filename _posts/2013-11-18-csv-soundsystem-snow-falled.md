<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're bringing me down<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're bringing me down<br/>
<br/>
A whole world in a page<br/>
Optimized to engage<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're bringing me down<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, a year older<br/>
And you're wasting my time<br/>
<br/>
Our metrics all show<br/>
Readers spend little time.<br/>
<br/>
But they Xeroxed your source<br/>
When you opened the doors<br/>
To execs who were told<br/>
that it could save their site<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, you're perfect<br/>
Don't please don't change a thing<br/>
<br/>
Your styled Pulitzer flare<br/>
They're convinced you're a king<br/>
<br/>
So the knock-offs collect<br/>
I mean all disrespect<br/>
<br/>
In the conference halls<br/>
I'd once dreamt I would speak<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're Jockey-ing me out<br/>
<br/>
You built yours on scrollkit<br/>
So there's no need to tout<br/>
<br/>
They've been decking the halls<br/>
I saw one on The Awl<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're freaking me out<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're scrolling me down<br/>
<br/>
Snow Fall, I Love You<br/>
But you're scrolling me down<br/>
<br/>
Let's say 'Death to this art!'<br/>
Duenes, where do I start?<br/>
<br/>
But you're still the one form<br/>
That's more than a noun<br/>
<br/>
And oh.. Take me off this parallax kick<br/>
For kids that think it's requisite<br/>
Yes, for those who think it's requisite<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm wrong<br/>
And maybe you're right<br/>
Maybe I'm wrong<br/>
And maybe you're right<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you're right<br/>
Maybe I'm wrong<br/>
And just maybe you're right<br/>
<br/>
And Ohhhhhhhhhhh..<br/>
Maybe Maggy told you true<br/>
And you'll get to Snow Fall with @KevinQ<br/>
And you'll never scroll alone<br/>
<br/>
But maybe she's wrong<br/>
And maybe I'm right<br/>
And just maybe she's wrong<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she's wrong<br/>
And maybe I'm right<br/>
And if so, is there?<br/>
