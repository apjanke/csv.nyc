This week, "Don't Lie" by Vampire Weekend re-imagined as a conversation between an obsessive Mechanical Turker and their would-be significant other who is trying to break the addiction.
<br/>
News peg: The release of [Transcribable](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/transcribable-free-the-files-to-go), which you should all check out.

<br/>
One click sends cents all around<br/>
Young bloods can't be settling down<br/>
Young hearts need transcriptions inbound<br/>
So serve me more my baby<br/>
<br/>
Don't lie, I want 'em to know<br/>
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?<br/>
It's my last time running this form<br/>
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know, does it bother you?<br/>
The low click of the ticking clock<br/>
There's a lifetime right in front of you<br/>
And everyone I know<br/>
<br/>
Young turks, young Saturday nights<br/>
Young eyes shouldn't stare just at bytes<br/>
Old flames to exist must ignite<br/>
So close the screen my baby<br/>
<br/>
Don't lie, I want 'em to know<br/>
Got high HIT now all tasks are gold<br/>
It's my last time running this form<br/>
But the drinks are free and the button is bold.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know, does it bother you?<br/>
The low click of the ticking clock<br/>
There's a headstone right in front of you<br/>
And every Turk I know<br/>
<br/>
Don't lie, I want 'em to know<br/>
AWS Turks die young, is he ready to go?<br/>
It's not the last time running this form<br/>
Cause the hires come fast and friction is low.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know, does it bother you?<br/>
The low click of the ticking clock<br/>
There's a lifetime right in front of you<br/>
And every Turk I know<br/>
