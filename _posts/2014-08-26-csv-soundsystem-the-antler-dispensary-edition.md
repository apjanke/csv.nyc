Last week we went across the street to the Antler Beer & Wine Dispensary and liked it quite a bit. They have a whole room with couches, tables and stools. It's right across the street from Berkli Parc so Delancey and Allen, Northwest corner. It's right under a sign for the "Yeah man span"

We'll be there tonight starting around 7.

Songs to resume post-NewsLynx. In the meantime, submission welcome.
