Tech it up, tech it up<br/>
<br/>
Buddy gonna shut you down<br/>
<br/>
It happened at CSV, where power outlets are few<br/>
(Oooo rev it up now)<br/>
Two cool laptops standing side-by-side<br/>
(Oooo rev it up now)<br/>
Yeah, my Ruby-injected Macbook and a Windows PC<br/>
<br/>
(Oooo rev it up now)<br/>
Revvin' up our if-then loops and it sounds real mean<br/>
(Oooo rev it up now)<br/>
<br/>
Tech it up, tech it up, tech it up<br/>
Buddy gonna shut you down<br/>
<br/>
Declinin' counters at an even rate<br/>
(Oooo movin' out now)<br/>
At the count of one we both run our scripts<br/>
(Oooo movin' out now)<br/>
My Macbook’s light the mouse pointer’s starting to spin<br/>
(Oooo movin' out now)<br/>
But the IRb is ready to go<br/>
Oooo movin' out now)<br/>
<br/>
Gotta be cool now counter variable here we go<br/>
<br/>
The PC running Python is windin' out in low<br/>
But my Ruby-injected Mac’s really startin' to go<br/>
To get the traction I'm defining my own math functions<br/>
The power plug’s burnin' that machine's too much<br/>
<br/>
Command prompts running, watch the code fly by<br/>
(Oooo pump it up now)<br/>
And now PC’s lead is startin' to shrink<br/>
(Oooo pump it up now)<br/>
He's hot with his break and continue statements but it's understood<br/>
(Oooo pump it up now)<br/>
I got a Ruby-injected Macbook sittin' under my hood<br/>
(Oooo pump it up now)<br/>
<br/>
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down<br/>
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down<br/>
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down<br/>
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down<br/>
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down <br/>
<br/>
