Let us type then, you and I, <br/>
Into spreadsheets spread against the sky <br/>
Like an object melted into a table. <br/>
Let us go, through certain half-converted sheets, <br/>
The muttering bip-bleeps <br/>
Of mismatched types on one-night cheap cloud cells, <br/>
All fluorescent glints in Telco hotels: <br/>
Hallways that cut like layers in cake <br/>
(Or quiche, it's with spinach they make) <br/>
To lead you to an overwhelming question... <br/>
Oh do not ask, "What format is it?" <br/>
Join us won't you to delimit? <br/>
