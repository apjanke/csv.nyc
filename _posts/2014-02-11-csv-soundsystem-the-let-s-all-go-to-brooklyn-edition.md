This week we'll be meeting today (tuesday) at 7pm at a new location, 61 Local in Cobble Hill. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/61-local-brooklyn
<br/><br/>
You can grab the FG subways to Bergen Street.
<br/><br/>
We are switching away from Whynot Coffee because they now have music in the Jazz Room (it took us by surprise) and a cover. We're hoping 61 Local isn't too far out of people's way. We've been thinking about moving it here for some time, though, since it has a lot of space, reliable WiFi, and more actual food options than the other places. If it doesn't work, though, send us an email to this address and let us know.
<br/><br/>
Join us, won't you?

I tried really hard to come up with a good song this week but it wasn't quite up to our standards. To make up for it, here's the YouTube search results page for "Werner Herzog reads" https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=werner%20herzog%20reads&sm=3
