The Fresh Prince of my MacBook Air

<br/>
Now, this is a story all about how<br/>
My PATH got flipped-turned upside down<br/>
And I'd like to take a minute<br/>
Just sit right there<br/>
I'll tell you how I became the Prince of my MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
In West Shenzhen, assembled and praised<br/>
On the assembly line was where it spent most of its days<br/>
Bootin' up, brewin' super-rootin' all cool<br/>
Shootin' some sudo outside of school<br/>
When a couple of guys<br/>
Who were up to such guile<br/>
Startin' making trouble in my bash profile<br/>
They deleted one little colon, snickered and blared<br/>
They said: "You'll never eye imports my cursed little Air."<br/>
<br/>
I pip'ed for my packages, kickin' the Mac into gear<br/>
But scripts runnin' errors sayin': "Yo this package ain't here."<br/>
If anything I can say is that this PATH's not aware<br/>
So I let's echo and vet it: "I'll fix you my Air!"<br/>
<br/>
I opened up my profile and saw about seven or eight folders running together.<br/>
I yelled to the screen: "Yo homes, you must delimit!"<br/>
I re-saved my path.<br/>
My packages were finally there.<br/>
I sat on my throne as the Prince of my MacBook Air<br/>
<br/>
