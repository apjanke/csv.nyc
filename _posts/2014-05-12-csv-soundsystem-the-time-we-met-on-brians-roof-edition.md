When this old box starts shutting me down<br/>
Permissions are too much for me to face<br/>
I climb way up to top of the stack<br/>
And all my cares just drift to userspace<br/>
sudo su, it's peaceful as can be<br/>
And there the proles below can't bother me<br/>
Let me tell you now<br/>
 <br/>
When I come ~/ feelin' tired and beat<br/>
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (up on the root)<br/>
I get away from the hustling crowd<br/>
And all that rat-race noise down in the street (up on the root)<br/>
On the root, the only place I know<br/>
Where you don't need permish to make it so<br/>
Let's go up on the root (up on the root)<br/>
 <br/>
At night find /* puts on a show for me<br/>
And, darling, /usr/share/ it all with me<br/>
I keep chsh-ellin you<br/>
Right smack dab in the middle of chown<br/>
I've found a paradise for all my groups (all my groups)<br/>
And if this curl starts GETing you down<br/>
There's room enough for two<br/>
Up on the root (up on the root)<br/>
Up on the roo-oo-oot (up on the root)<br/>
Oh, come on, baby (up on the root)<br/>
Oh, come on, honey (up on the root)<br/>
 <br/>
Everything is all right (up on the root)<br/>
<br/>

join us, wont you?<br/>
