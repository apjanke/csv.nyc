hey all,

We'll be doing csv tonight at our regularly scheduled time.  I (Brian) will be showing up a bit late so I can attend my friend's art opening, which should be pretty awesome if you want to join:

Door's open at 6, but they won't go on until 7:30. I'll be going to Think afterwards.


An excerpt from T.S. Elliot's Little Gidding:


We shall not cease from st_transformation <br>
And the end of all our transforming <br>
Will be to arrive at where we started <br>
And to know the place for the first time <br>

join us, won't you?
