I Wanna Hack With Somebody - Whitney Houston feat. Brian + Michael<br/>

<br/>
Ah<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Wooo!<br/>
<br/>
Hey-ya<br/>
Ha<br/>
Hoo-ya<br/>
Aha<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I want to hack<br/>
<br/>
Mac clicks into the power<br/>
As the battery begins to fade<br/>
Not enough time to figure out<br/>
How best to load this page<br/>
I've done alright up 'til now<br/>
Stack overflow shows me how<br/>
When sqlite stalls,<br/>
Low-level code calls<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:] x2<br/>
Oh! I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
Control-alt-delete with somebody<br/>
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody <br/>
With somebody who loves C<br/>
<br/>
Iâ€™ve been in love and lost my senses<br/>
Spinning servers up and down<br/>
Sooner or later the fever ends<br/>
And I get kicked off the cloud<br/>
I need a clan maybe in finance<br/>
Who can teach me to utilize my RAM<br/>
When sqlite stalls<br/>
Low-level code calls<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:]<br/>
Oh! I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
I wanna be 1337 with somebody<br/>
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody <br/>
With somebody who loves C<br/>
<br/>
Oh! I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
I wanna autocomplete...<br/>
Yeah! I wanna hack with somebody <br/>
With somebody who loves C<br/>
<br/>
Somebody hoo! Somebody hoo!<br/>
Somebody who loves C yeah!<br/>
Somebody hoo! Somebody hoo!<br/>
Controlling server farms, oh<br/>
I need a clan maybe in finance<br/>
Who can teach me to utilize my RAM<br/>
When sqlite stalls<br/>
Low-level code calls<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
I wanna live tweet with somebody<br/>
Yeah, I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
With somebody who loves C<br/>
Oh, I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
I wanna gcc with somebody<br/>
Yeah, I wanna hack with somebody<br/>
With somebody who loves C<br/>
<br/>
Ooh--ooh hoooo<br/>
