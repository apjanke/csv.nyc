This week, the Cascades' 1962 classic "Algorithms on the Contact Chain" -- the prescient ballad of a love who flees the singer after he reveals his suspicions of being surveilled, putting her under the two-hop threshold.<br/>

Listen to algorithms on the contact chain<br/>
Telling me just what a tool I've been<br/>
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain<br/>
And let me be alone again<br/>
 <br/>
The only girl I care about has gone away<br/>
Showing up in a two-hop chart<br/>
But little does she know that when she left that day<br/>
Along with her she took my heart<br/>
 <br/>
Chain, please tell me now does that seem wise<br/>
For you to read my heart based on contact size<br/>
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away<br/>
 <br/>
The only girl I care about has gone away<br/>
Showing up in a two hop chart<br/>
But little does she know that when she left that day<br/>
Along with her she took my heart<br/>
 <br/>
Chain, it will tell you that I love her so<br/>
Sending lovers' missives all of this you know<br/>
Reign in your chart and let the love we knew start to grow<br/>
 <br/>
Listen to algorithms on the contact chain<br/>
Telling me just what a tool I've been<br/>
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain<br/>
And let me be alone again<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, listen to the contact chain<br/>
Chitter chatter, chitter chatter<br/>
Oh, listen, listen to the contact chain<br/>
Chitter chatter, chitter chatter<br/>
Oh, listen, listen to the contact chain<br/>
<br/>
