title: csv soundsystem, The Passion Pit Abstraction Layer Edition
---


Post-holidays, we're back to Tuesdays at 6:45pm at Whynot Coffee & Wine in the West Village, which will be our regular meeting time and place. We have officially left Think Coffee. It had a good run but this new location has better wifi and is usually less crowded. They have two locations so be careful not to end up in the east village. Here's a map: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whynot-coffee-and-wine-new-york
<br/><br/>
We usually stay till around 9 or 10 so if you have any kind of project you want to work on around other folks who might be able to lend a hand or whom you could just chat with, we'll be there.
<br/><br/>
Join us, won't you?

This week's song is an abstraction layer over Passion Pit's Sleepyhead. Think of it like Esperanto but with less of a one-to-one semantic relationship to other languages or like baby-babble but with more of a beat.
