We'll be convening tomorrow at Fat Cat Fab Lab for their Open House Tuesdays (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/fat-cat-fab-lab/events/177243572/">http://www.meetup.com/fat-cat-fab-lab/events/177243572/</a>). It starts at 6, but we'll probably show up a bit later. There's also a chance that we'll put down on our laptops and play games. <br/>
