Last week saw <br/>
Julian guffaw <br/>
At my use so grave <br/>
of no trim_trailing_white_space_on_save <br/>
Thomas so productive <br/>
and instructive <br/>
had a computer <br/>
No more giant art pad in pewter <br/>
The quiche stale <br/>
the crust pale <br/>
Mint tea great <br/>
Much we ate <br/>
And much was done! <br/>
At least one pun! <br/>
Yet still much to do <br/>
Join us, won't you? <br/>
