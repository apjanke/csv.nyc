I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
Twenty-six TBs to compute<br>
Spun up the servers, 125 <br>
Praying to god that my script stays alive <br>
I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
<br>
Hey, twitter, what links are going around?<br>
Hey, pitchfork, what's the newest sound?<br>
Oh pardon me sir, let me switch my tabs<br>
just taking a break while amazon does math<br>
I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
<br>
what's for lunch? I think I need a snack<br>
Mexican spot on 48th ave.<br>
I'm gonna get the same thing as before<br>
First thing you learn is to order al pastor<br>
I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
<br>
Back to the office, up three flights of stairs <br>
tweet fit bit progress, but nobody cares <br>
check the admin, get a quick update<br>
only halfway there, I got more time to waste <br>
I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
<br>
the console hollers, it starts to bawl and shout <br>
Runtime Error, how'm I gonna work it  out?<br>
but I'm feeling good cause it's a quarter to five<br>
Come tomorrow I'll just change a couple lines<br>
I'm waiting for hadoop<br>
