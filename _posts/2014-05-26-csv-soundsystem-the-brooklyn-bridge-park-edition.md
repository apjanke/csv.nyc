title: csv soundsystem, The Brooklyn Bridge Park Edition
---
To continue our Outdoor Summer Series, we'll be convening at Pier 6 of the Brooklyn Bridge Park this week, Tuesday the 27th, and cooking dinner on the grill. We'll bring a healthy amount of vegetables along with hamburgers and hot dogs. There's a 60 percent chance of rain but there also umbrellas.<br/>
<br/>
There's wifi and we also have a hotspot if you want to work on some stuff or show a project.<br/>
<br/>
Pier 6 is on the southern part of the park closest to Atlantic Avenue. The nearest subways are Borough Hall on the 2345 or Jay Street on the ACF.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a map of the park. The table area is between Pier 5 and 6.<br/>
