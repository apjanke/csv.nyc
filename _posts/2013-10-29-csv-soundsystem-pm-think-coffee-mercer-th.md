It's the Markov life for us<br/>
It's the Markov life for us<br/>
Instead of tweeting, we just twit<br/>
Instead of trolling, we write scripts<br/>
It's the Markov life!<br/>
<br/>
From startin' out my random walkin'<br/>
Transition only to the terms a word has even seen <br/>
To dropping some of the hottest phrases Twitter's ever heard<br/>
From the tweet bots and Ebooks - it ain't a dying meme<br/>
You know me well...<br/>
From late nights in a trolling spell, my only hell<br/>
is when Twitter blocks my g-mail, Fuck naw!<br/>
where all my hackers with the python scripts, make bots!<br/>
And if you with me Andrey, get stochastic, and what-not<br/>
I'm from the school of the Markovs, you must not<br/>
Let outsiders call us 'spam bots', and my plot<br/>
slice up the corpus, split it 50/50, uh-huh<br/>
And take the model, train it real pretty, uh-huh<br/>
A drunkard's walk - I get pissy-pissy<br/>
Flow infinitely, no memory, I just transition quickly, baby!<br/>
You know it's hell when I come through<br/>
The life and times of horse_ebooks, baby, Volume 2, y'all trolls get ready<br/>
<br/>
It's the Markov life for us<br/>
It's the Markov life for us<br/>
Instead of tweeting, we just twit<br/>
Instead of trolling, we write scripts<br/>
It's the Markov life!<br/>
