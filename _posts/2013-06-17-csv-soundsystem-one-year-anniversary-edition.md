title: csv soundsystem, one year anniversary edition
---

<br/>
As Brian mentioned last week, tomorrow, Tuesday June 17th, is the one year anniversary of our first csv soundsystem meetup. To mark the occasion, here's a greeting card with a number of superfluous jQuery UI effects, CSS animations, and an offer of free quiche:<br/> [http://csvsoundsystem.github.io/one-year-anniversary-fireworks/](http://csvsoundsystem.github.io/one-year-anniversary-fireworks/)
<br/>
<br/>
The song / poem this week is an insanely awesome riff on De La Soul's The Magic Number written by Mr. Alastair Dant. Read the lyrics below while jamming along with video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irL1M15DH8
<br/>
<br/>
We'll see you tomorrow at 6:45pm at the Think Coffee at Mercer and 4th.

Tree<br/>
That's the magic lumber<br/>
Yes it is<br/>
It's the magic lumber<br/>
Somewhere in the data/bass community<br/>
Was born tree - root, branch and leaf<br/>
And that's the magic lumber<br/>
<br/>
(What does it all mean? )<br/>
<br/>
Difficult parsing is seldom a pleasure<br/>
Pleasure and parsing starts from the root<br/>
Script that reconstructs a node graph is the measure<br/>
Measure out the branches, space to compute<br/>
<br/>
Casually su but don't do in that role<br/>
'Cause suin' and doin' are actions for func keys<br/>
Doin' data hustle, no block or poll<br/>
Unless your name's ROOT_ERR, 'cause ROOT_ERR's too chunky<br/>
<br/>
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air<br/>
Criticising stacks shows you're out of order<br/>
Stop look and listen to the round-robin pairs<br/>
And don't get offended when place row-to-row's your daughter<br/>
<br/>
A try-catch block and the loop is now set<br/>
Nodes get stored in a d.a.I.s.y. production<br/>
It stands for "da inner source y'all" and you can bet<br/>
Our action lasts a tick, not slowing the function<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants a tree in NodeJ<br/>
Everybody wants to nest in D3<br/>
But simple recurse is the best<br/>
And you don't have to guess<br/>
The C S V persists a tree<br/>
And that's the magic lumber<br/>
