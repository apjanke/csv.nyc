title: csv soundsystem, The "Big Data: The Board Game" Edition
---
This week we'll be meeting around 6:45 at The Uncommons, a board game cafe near Washington Sq. Here's a map: http://www.uncommonsnyc.com/visit/

Last week at the Fat Cab Fab Lab, we had the idea that we should design and build a board game about Big Data since the Fab Lab has all the tools to do that. We have some ideas as well as aspirations and we're going to talk more about it this week.

But, csv soundsystem is anti-official agenda so there is no official agenda if you're not into board game design. And yet, don't be surprised if some people are talking about the implications of David Hume's theories on causality as they apply to board game dynamics.

An appropriate song for this week might have been Under the Boardwalk (and would have kept with our Drifters theme) but it's 10:30 and I just got home :(

If anyone wants to write that one, though, please send it in.
