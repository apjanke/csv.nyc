Desert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listened to your lies would you say
I'm a man page
without conviction
I'm a man page
who is full of
Flags and contradictions
You comma and go
You comma and go
Comma Comma Comma Comma Comma Chameleon
You comma and go
You comma and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my PS1
Red gold and green
Red gold and green
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my shell
was an addiction
When we bind
our love is strong
When you reboot
you're gone forever
Your strings are long
Your strings are long
Every day is like a survival
You're my lover not my rival
Every day is like a survival
You're my lover not my rival
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You comma and go
You comma and go
