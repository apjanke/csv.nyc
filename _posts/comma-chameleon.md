Desert loving in your eyes all the way<br/>
If I listened to your lies would you say<br/>
I'm a man page<br/>
without conviction<br/>
I'm a man page<br/>
who is full of<br/>
Flags and contradictions<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
Comma Comma Comma Comma Comma Chameleon<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my PS1<br/>
Red gold and green<br/>
Red gold and green<br/>
Didn't hear your wicked words every day<br/>
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say<br/>
That my shell<br/>
was an addiction<br/>
When we bind<br/>
our love is strong<br/>
When you reboot<br/>
you're gone forever<br/>
Your strings are long<br/>
Your strings are long<br/>
Every day is like a survival<br/>
You're my lover not my rival<br/>
Every day is like a survival<br/>
You're my lover not my rival<br/>
I'm a man without conviction<br/>
I'm a man who doesn't know<br/>
How to sell a contradiction<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
You comma and go<br/>
