Every day and night</br>
Every day and night</br>
I can see your requests requests, hits are suckin power out the hive mind</br>
I'm outta time, I'm outta fuckin time</br>
Your app is so glut, cloggin all the pipelines, but</br>
Wanna resize? Wanna see me resize?</br>
Watch me scale up in practically no time</br>
One, two, three, four</br>
You got what you been asking for</br>
With your private id and your terminal shell, see everything I see</br>
And everything I feel is alright,</br>
alright, alright, alright, alright</br>
</br>
You check the logs now watch me get you hot</br>
Your just in char-set when your screaming</br>
And your shouting "less errors please, less errors please"</br>
You want what you want but you don't really know all your needs</br>
Who does your, your data layer?</br>
</br>
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?</br>
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?</br>
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?</br>
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?</br>
</br>
How are you?</br>
</br>
Fine, thanks.</br>
</br>
How are you?</br>
</br>
Fine, thanks.</br>
</br>
You bought a new rack, your first series-A stack</br>
"At scale" but I really gotta say "stop"</br>
Because I'm so core that I could outperform</br>
Even with a stupid fuckin Dell Pentium board, Dell Pentium board</br>
Your servers are dumb like a Dell Pentium board</br>
I'll walk on it</br>
I'll walk all over you</br>
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two</br>
Who? Who? Who? Who?</br>
</br>
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?</br>
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?</br>
Who needs some Dom in London-a-don-a-don?</br>
Who needs some Ram in the River Delta Mekong?</br>
