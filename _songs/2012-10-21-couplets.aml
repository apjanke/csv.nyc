lyrics: Commas pipes tabs and spaces
When one goes astray it makes angry faces.
Formatting addresses don't even get me started,
My geocoded results are something Kepler would've charted.
So bring your laptop and join in the fun ever so
of making and scripting with csv & co.
Tuesday at 7, there's beer wine and quiche
Join us, won't you? Whatever your niche.
