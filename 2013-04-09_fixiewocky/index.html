  <div class="lyrics">`Twas a fixie with poor slithy widths<br/>  Did gyre and gimble on the page:<br/>All mimsy were the headrares,<br/>  And the fly parths outdades.<br/><br/>"Beware the Fixiewock, my son!<br/>  The line strings that bite, the indents that catch!<br/>Beware the Footnote bird, and shun<br/>  The frumious Text-to-columns-snatch!"<br/><br/>He took his parsal Python in hand:<br/>  Long time the text foe he sought --<br/>So rested he by the RegEx tree,<br/>  And stood awhile in UltraEdit.<br/><br/>And, as in csvish thought he stood,<br/>  The Fixiewock, with special characters of lame,<br/>Came whiffling through the hacky scraper,<br/>  And errbled as it came!<br/><br/>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>  The parsal script went snicker-snack!<br/>He left it dead, and with its output<br/>  He went piping back.<br/><br/>"And, has thou slain the Fixiewock?<br/>  Come to my arms, my tired boy!<br/>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br/>  His values in his joy.<br/><br/>`Twas a fixie with poor slithy widths<br/>  Did gyre and gimble on the page:<br/>All mimsy were the headrares,<br/>  And the fly parths outdades.</div>
